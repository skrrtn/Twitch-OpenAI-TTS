# SKRRTN's Twitch OpenAI TTS

:video_game: :robot: Real-time interaction with Twitch chat using OpenAI's text-to-speech (TTS) capabilities.

## Overview

SKRRTN's Twitch OpenAI TTS is a Python script that integrates OpenAI's TTS capabilities with Twitch chat. It allows users to ask questions in the Twitch chat, and the bot responds with synthesized speech generated by OpenAI's GPT-3 model.

## Features

- 🤖 **Real-time Interaction**: Engage with Twitch chat in real-time, processing questions and generating responses almost instantly.
- 🔊 **Speech Synthesis**: Automatically generate speech responses using OpenAI's powerful GPT-3 model.
- 🎲 **Random Question Prompts**: Keep chat engagement high by prompting random questions at configurable intervals.
- 🚫 **Bad Word Filtering**: Maintain a clean chat environment by filtering out inappropriate language.
- ⚙️ **Configurability**: Easily configure various aspects of the bot, such as Twitch credentials, OpenAI API settings, system options, and limits.

## Installation

1. **Clone this repository**:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/skrrtn/Twitch-OpenAI-TTS.git
   ```

2. **Install the required dependencies** from `requirements.txt`:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

3. **Configure the `config.json` file** with your Twitch and OpenAI API credentials, as well as other settings. Detailed explanation of configuration options can be found below.

## Configuration

The `config.json` file contains several sections for configuring different aspects of the bot:

- **twitch**: Configure Twitch-related settings such as server, port, nickname, token, channel, bad word filtering, and timeout duration.
- **openai**: Configure OpenAI API settings including API key, system message, model, and TTS model.
- **system**: Configure system settings such as audio device IDs for question TTS and response TTS.
- **limits**: Configure various limits and intervals for the bot, including user question interval, character limit, random question interval, and more.

Here's an example of a `config.json` file:

```json
{
  "twitch": {
    "server": "irc.chat.twitch.tv", # Main Twitch IRC Server
    "port": 6667, # Twitch IRC Port
    "nickname": "your_bot_nickname", # Nickname from the OAuth Token
    "token": "your_oauth_token", # Your Twitch OAuth Token
    "channel": "#your_channel", # What channel to join and monitor
    "bad_word_filter_enabled": true, # Do you want to filter bad words? Be sure to update badwords.txt
    "timeout_seconds": 600 # How long someone should be timed out for using a bad word
  },
  "openai": {
    "api_key": "your_openai_api_key", # Found at platform.openai.com/api-keys
    "system_message": "My name is Jeff", # Give ChatGPT a prompt or personality
    "model": "gpt-3.5-turbo", # Can be any v1/chat/completions model, 3.5 turbo seems to be decent and cheap
    "tts_model": "tts-1", # Can either be tts-1 or tts-1-hd
    "voice": "fable" # Can be alloy, echo, fable, onyx, nova, and shimmer
  },
  "system": {
    "question_tts_device_id": 0, # Which audio device to play questions on
    "response_tts_device_id": 1 # Which audio device to play answers on
  },
  "limits": {
    "user_question_interval": 30, # How long before a user is allowed to ask another question
    "char_limit": 250, # Character limit of the question
    "random_questions_enabled": true, # If no questions are asked, should we play a random question?
    "random_question_idle_time": 60 # If the queue is empty, how long before we play a random question?
  }
}
```

Make sure to set these values according to your preferences before running the bot.

## Usage

Run the script `main.py` to start the Twitch bot:
```bash
python main.py
```
You can now start asking the bot questions in chat using the "!q" followed by a question.
> !q What does blue taste like?
<br>
The bot will then process the question and add it to a queue. For each question, a request is made to OpenAI twice. Once for generating an AI response and again to convert the response to audio. We will then retrieve the response audio and process the queue.

## Which Audio Device To Use
In order to play the audio correctly, we need the correct audio device output. You can find the audio output devices on your system by running **'device_check.py'**.
```bash
python device_check.py
```
This should show you ALL the outputs on your system. It is up to you to choose the correct one and update the config accordingly. I seperated the audio devices for use with OBS, but you can always use the same one for both the question and response.

## Whats with the text files?

The text files are setup in a way to use them as sources in OBS Studio. This is will allow you to show the questions and answers on stream in real time. When a question is processed, we add the question to 'question.txt' and update 'queue.txt' to show how many questions are in queue. Once a response is returned, we then add that to 'response.txt'. If you set these files to sources in OBS, it will update automatically. After a response is played, it will clear the files and update the 'queue.txt' accordingly. 
<br><br>
Good practice for showing the text effeciently, right click the text source and **'Edit Transform'** *(or CTRL-E)*.<br>
Set **'Positional Alignment'** and **'Alignment In Bounding Box'** to **'Center'**.<br>
Set **'Bounding Box Type'** to **'Scale To Inner Bounds'**.<br><br>
Now, you can make the text box the size you want, and the text will always stay within that box. Play around for better results!

## Obtaining an OpenAI API Key

To use OpenAI's API, you'll need to obtain an API key from the OpenAI platform. Here's how to get started:

1. **Sign up or log in** to your OpenAI account at [OpenAI's website](https://platform.openai.com/).
2. **Navigate to API keys**: Once logged in, go to the "API keys" section of your account settings.
3. **Generate an API key**: Click on the "Generate API Key" button to create a new API key. Make sure to copy the generated key securely.
4. **Add the API key to your `config.json`**: Paste the copied API key into the `api_key` field under the `openai` section of your `config.json` file.

## Generating an OAuth Token

To connect the bot to your Twitch channel, you'll need to generate an OAuth token. Here's how to do it:

1. **Visit the Twitch Chat OAuth Password Generator**: Go to [Twitch Chat OAuth Password Generator](https://twitchapps.com/tmi/) in your web browser. Make sure you are already logged in to your Twitch account.
2. **Click "Connect"**: Once on the website, simply click the "Connect" button. This will authorize the application to access your Twitch account for chat purposes.
3. **Copy the Token**: After clicking "Connect", you'll be redirected back to the website, and you should see your OAuth token displayed. Copy this token securely.
4. **Use the Token in the Config**: Paste the copied OAuth token into the `token` field under the `twitch` section of your `config.json` file. Set the `nickname` field to your Twitch username.
